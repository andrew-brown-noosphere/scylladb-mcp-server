# ScyllaDB MCP Demo Scenarios

## The Developer Journey: Discovery ‚Üí Install ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí Benefit

### Scenario 1: Discovery - "I have a DynamoDB problem"

**Developer**: "My DynamoDB costs are killing me - $50K/month and growing"

**MCP Response** (cynical voice):
```
50K/month? Let me guess - provisioned capacity you're not using, 
or on-demand pricing eating you alive? Either way, AWS thanks you.

Want to see what that workload costs on ScyllaDB? 
Run: costEstimate --reads_per_sec 50000 --writes_per_sec 10000 --storage_gb 5000
```

**Developer**: "Is ScyllaDB compatible with my DynamoDB code?"

**MCP Response**:
```
Compatible? Your code doesn't even know the difference.
Same API, different endpoint. 

Let me analyze your code to be sure:
Run: analyzeWorkload --code_path ./your-app
```

### Scenario 2: Install - "OK, let me try it"

**Developer**: "How do I install ScyllaDB?"

**MCP Response**:
```
Install? This is 2024. 
Run: connect

I'll spin up a Docker container. CQL on 9042, Alternator on 8000.
You don't even need to know Docker. I'll handle it.
```

*[MCP automatically starts container, waits for it to be ready]*

**Result**:
```
‚úÖ Connected to ScyllaDB (CQL)
‚úÖ Connected to Alternator (DynamoDB API)
üê≥ Docker container: scylladb-mcp

Alternator endpoint: http://localhost:8000
Just change your endpoint URL. Even you can't mess this up. Probably.
```

### Scenario 3: Configure - "Let me test my code"

**Developer**: "Here's my DynamoDB code - will it work?"

```python
table.put_item(Item={'user_id': '123', 'data': 'test'})
response = table.query(KeyConditionExpression=Key('user_id').eq('123'))
```

**MCP Response**:
```
Let's find out. Run your code with endpoint_url='http://localhost:8000'
Or use: checkMigration --code "your code here"

*[Runs code]*

‚úÖ Code executed successfully. 
Same boto3 calls, same results. Told you it would work.
Want to see the performance difference? That's where it gets interesting...
```

### Scenario 4: Benefit - "Show me the money"

**Developer**: "OK it works, but what about performance?"

**MCP Response**:
```
Now we're talking. Let's load some data and compare:
Run: populateData --source dynamodb_style --table users --rows 10000

Then: comparePerformance --operation mixed --itemCount 10000
```

**Performance Results**:
```
DynamoDB:
- P99 latency: 25.5ms
- Throughput: 1,950 ops/sec
- Throttled requests: 34
- Monthly cost: ~$15,000

ScyllaDB:
- P99 latency: 2.8ms (9x better)
- Throughput: 13,500 ops/sec (7x better)
- Throttled requests: 0
- Monthly cost: ~$4,500 (70% cheaper)

No throttling. No capacity planning. Just hardware doing what hardware does.
The other benefit? You sleep better at 3am.
```

**Developer**: "What about hot partitions?"

**MCP Response**:
```
Good question. Someone's been burned before.
Let me analyze your access patterns:

*[Analyzes code]*

Found it: user_id='admin' gets 90% of traffic.
That's one shard doing all the work while 31 others watch Netflix.

In DynamoDB, you'd throw money at it.
In ScyllaDB, you fix the design:
- Time-bucket the partition key
- Or hash-distribute the hot key
- Or cache it

Physics still applies. Even at web scale.
```

### Scenario 5: Systems Design - "We followed AWS best practices"

**Developer**: "We used AWS's DynamoDB Data Modeling MCP tool. We have 3 GSIs and use Streams for fan-out patterns."

**MCP Response**:
```
Smart design - for DynamoDB's constraints. Let's talk systems design.

Those 3 GSIs? You're paying 4x for every write. Why? Because 
DynamoDB's architecture requires copying data for each index.

That Streams + Lambda pattern? That's an admission that the 
database can't handle your workload directly.

In ScyllaDB:
- Your GSIs become materialized views. No extra charges.
- Fan-out? Handle it in the query. No Lambda needed.
- Same access patterns, simpler architecture.

Want to see what your design looks like without the workarounds?
Run: analyzeDynamoDBModel --data_model "your model"
```

**Follow-up**:
```
Here's the thing about the AWS tool - it's optimizing within a cage.

It says "use Streams" because DynamoDB can't handle fan-out.
It says "use OpenSearch" because DynamoDB can't search efficiently.
It says "plan capacity" because DynamoDB throttles arbitrarily.

We're not saying your design is wrong. We're saying you 
shouldn't need all these workarounds.

The best Lambda function is the one you don't write.
The best external service is the one you don't need.
```

### Bonus: The "Convince the Boss" Scenario

**Developer**: "How do I convince my manager?"

**MCP Response**:
```
Money talks. Here's your executive summary:

Current DynamoDB: $50K/month = $600K/year
ScyllaDB equivalent: $15K/month = $180K/year
Savings: $420K/year

Plus:
- No throttling during traffic spikes
- No 3am pages about capacity
- Same code, better performance

ROI: 3 months including migration.
After that, pure savings.

Or keep paying for throttling. Engineering decision, not a business one.
```

## Demo Flow Tips

1. **Start skeptical** - Let the developer be doubtful
2. **Show immediate value** - Working code in minutes
3. **Use real numbers** - Actual costs, actual latency
4. **Address fears** - "Will my code work?" ‚Üí Yes, here's proof
5. **End with impact** - 70% cost savings, 9x performance

The cynical voice makes it memorable while the tools provide real value.
